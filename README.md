# üß† Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) Experiments

This repository is a collection of **experiments and demos** with [snnTorch](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/) and PyTorch, exploring the fascinating world of **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**.

SNNs are brain-inspired neural networks that process information using **spikes** (discrete events in time), rather than continuous activations.  
They allow us to explore:  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Temporal dynamics** (not just *what* happens, but *when*)  
- ‚ö° **Energy efficiency** (ideal for neuromorphic hardware)  
- üß¨ **Biological plausibility** in AI models
